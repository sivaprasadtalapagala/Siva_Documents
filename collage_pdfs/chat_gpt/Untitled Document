1.1. Market THEORITICAL BACKGROUND

Market: A market is a place where people exchange things they want or need. Think of it like a giant store where you can buy or sell items. When you go to a supermarket and choose fruits to buy, you're participating in a market.
Marketing: Marketing is how businesses try to understand what people want and then create and promote products or services to satisfy those wants. It's like a company trying to make something that people will like and then telling them about it. For example, when a company makes a new smartphone and advertises its features, that's marketing.
Definition of Marketing: Marketing means everything a company does to create, promote, and sell its products or services. It involves understanding what people need and want and making sure they can get those things. Just think of it as the way companies connect with people to provide things they want.
Buyer Behavior: Buyer behavior is how people make decisions about what to buy. Imagine you want to buy a new pair of shoes. First, you realize you need new shoes because your old ones are worn out. Then, you might look online for different shoe options and read reviews to help you choose. After considering your options, you pick the shoes you like the most and buy them. Finally, after wearing them for a while, you decide if you made a good choice.
Stages in Buying Decision Process:
    1. Problem Recognition: Let's say your phone keeps freezing, and you're frustrated with it. You realize you need a new phone because your current one isn't working well.
    2. Information Search: You start looking online and asking friends about different phone options. You check out websites, read reviews, and compare features to find a better phone.
    3. Evaluation of Alternatives: Based on your research, you narrow down your choices to a few phones that seem good. You think about their prices, features, and how they look.
    4. Purchase Decision: You finally decide on a particular phone that suits your needs and preferences. You go to the store or order it online and make the purchase.
    5. Post Purchase Behavior: After using the new phone for a while, you decide if you're happy with your choice. If it works well and meets your expectations, you'll likely feel satisfied with your decision. If not, you might regret the purchase.
Different Marketing Concepts:
    1. Production Concept: This concept focuses on making a lot of products at a low cost. An example is a company that produces basic T-shirts in bulk, so they're cheap and widely available.
    2. Product Concept: Here, the focus is on making products that are high-quality and have advanced features. An example is a smartphone brand that focuses on adding the latest technology and features to its phones.
    3. Selling Concept: This concept believes that products won't sell themselves, so companies need to aggressively promote and sell them. An example is a car dealership that uses strong sales tactics to convince customers to buy cars.
    4. Marketing Concept: This idea centers on understanding what customers want and then creating products that fulfill those wants better than competitors. An example is a company that develops a fitness tracker based on what customers really need for tracking their health.
    5. Societal Concept: This concept considers not only customer wants but also the well-being of society. An example is a company that focuses on making environmentally-friendly products that benefit both customers and the planet.
These concepts help companies decide how to approach their marketing strategies and better serve their customers.


1.2.Introduction to Customer Satisfaction: 
Customer satisfaction is how happy or disappointed someone feels about a product compared to what they expected. If the product is better than they thought, they're satisfied; if it's worse, they're dissatisfied. Companies want high customer satisfaction because satisfied customers are more likely to stick around, even when better options come along. For example, if a restaurant's food tastes even better than customers expected, they're likely to be satisfied.
Customer Retention: Most businesses usually focus on attracting new customers, but it's important to keep the ones you already have. The key to keeping customers is making them satisfied. When people are really happy with a product or service, they're more likely to stay loyal and not switch to another option. For instance, if an online streaming service provides a great experience, customers will continue to use it and not look for alternatives.
How Customers Are Satisfied: Imagine you buy a smartphone with certain expectations based on its brand. If the phone performs just as you expected, you're satisfied. If it performs even better than you thought, you're very satisfied. On the other hand, if it doesn't meet your expectations, you might be disappointed. So, satisfaction depends on how well the product matches or exceeds what you hoped for.
Study Design: Let's say a company named XYZ makes shoes. They want to understand how aware people are of their brand and how satisfied customers are with their shoes in different aspects. To do this, they'll talk to 120 customers and ask them questions about their experiences. They'll also look at their company's promotions to see if they're effective in increasing sales. However, this study's findings might not apply to all customers in the city, and busy customers might not spend much time answering questions.
Research Methodology: The company XYZ will collect information in two ways. They'll directly ask customers questions through surveys and interviews, which will give them accurate and fresh data. They'll also use existing data from company reports and other sources. They'll study customers in two cities, Ongole and Guntur, by asking 120 customers in those areas. They'll use statistical techniques like graphs and tests to analyze the data and find meaningful patterns.
Statistical Techniques Applied: One way to understand the data is by using a statistical tool called the chi-square test. This tool helps analyze quantitative data and compare proportions. For example, if XYZ wanted to see if there's a connection between shoe color and customer satisfaction, they could use the chi-square test. They'll also create graphs like pie charts and bar charts to show the information in an easy-to-understand way.
In simpler terms, all these topics are about figuring out what customers like, why they like it, and how a company can keep them happy. Just like how a good experience at your favorite restaurant makes you want to go back, companies want their customers to feel the same way about their products or services.
